You should be able to condense code for frames 1-9 into a loop
- Consider looping through 10; add case for third ball (logic appears to be matching)
Consider the algebra of the various cases

Frame 10 will require some noodling

Need to build a failsafe if user enters:
- X instead of 10 for strike
- / for a spare
- F for a foul
- - for 0
- frame_score > 10 (frames 1-9)

Eventually split this out into classes/methods
